# Dog Breed Classifier

This is a project implemented towards completion of Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Programm

This project implements dog breed classifier using CNN build either from scratch or using transfer learning.
Then it implements human face detector using opencv and cascades of haar like features  
and performs humorous classification of human faces to dog breeds.
